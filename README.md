# personal_timeline
A personal page regrouping all my code and art related projects

## Public WIP
This page is a first version for a website that would regroup my artistic and development work (that I kept appart till now for reasons I'm not sure about anymore).
It is supposed to be a public WIP, so the page built from this repo will deliberately be online whichever state of progress it is in.

*First launch* : 

## Jekyll
This web page, in its first version at least, is built with Jekyll and is based on the design and principles of my [webdev portfolio](https://pquod.github.io/dev_portfolio/). This portfolio itself will later on be integrated to this second website in a way I'm still figuring out.

## 1st version features
- [ ] Bilingual
- [ ] Light/dark theme (?)

## Steps to come
- [ ] Integrate my art website (totally remastered)
- [ ] Integrate my webdev portfolio
- [ ] Build a handmade CMS to post --> Keep working on [this one](https://github.com/PQuod/JStoMDJekyllPortfolio)
