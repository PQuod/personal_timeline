  I'm Lucie Desaubliaux, a french artist, writer and developer. This site is the first version of my personal page regrouping all my code and art related projects. It is supposed to be a public WIP, so this page will be built each time I work on it, whichever state of progress it is in.
baseurl: "/personal_timeline/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
