On december 2nd, I am in Paris to sign my children book *Les BÃªtes sauvages grandissent la nuit*. From 11AM to 1PM you can find me in the bookstore Atout Livre, alongside Marine Schneider who made the beautiful illustrations of the album. From 5.30PM to 7.30PM I am at [the Salon de Montreuil](https://slpjplus.fr/salon/), at Le Seuil's booth F24.
