Setu's amazing team invited me to write a text about the performances taking place during their 2024 edition. I'll be there in Elliant on the 24th & 25th of august, and I'll definitely bring my waterproof notebook with me. The final text will be published on the festival's [website](https://www.setufestival.com/), I'll post a link around here!
